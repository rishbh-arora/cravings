A Web app for Code-chef DEVSOC '23

## Brief
This webapp is predominantly built as for the night mess facility available in all hostels in Vellore Institute of Technology. The app enables the users to place orders online removing long queues to order at the desk. The mess recieves orders and sends notifications as soon as the orders are ready.

All mess are registered individually and can customize their own menu. Similarly, all student accounts are linked to a certain mess of their choice.
